Measure bar: | tokens |

All tokens within measure are seperated by white space
| X Y |W Z|

Repeated measure bars are ignored 
|tokens||tokens|

All whitespace is treated the same
|tokens   | tokens |
| tokens | 
<=>
| tokens | tokens | tokens | 

Repeat: Repeat sequence in current measure natural number of times
| tokens   | plays the sequence 1 time
| tokens  :| repeats the sequence 1 time
| tokens  :| <=> | tokens  | tokens  |
| tokens ::| repeats the sequence 2 times
| tokens ::| <=> | tokens  | tokens  | tokens  |
| tokens :N| repeats the sequence N times
| tokens :1| repeats the sequence 1 time
| tokens :5| repeats the sequence 5 times

":" or ":N" token must come at the of the measure or it will be ignored and a warning generated

Pitch / Note: A A#/Bb B C C#/Db D D#/Eb E F F#/Gb G G#/Ab

Octave Higher / 2X frequency: 'A# 'C 'Bb
2 Octaves Higher / 4X frequency: ''C# ''F

Octave Lower / 1/2 frequency: ,A# ,C ,Bb
2 Octaves Lower / 1/4 frequency: ,,C# ,,F

Duration: A natural number following the pitch representing the fraction of a whole note.
Whole Note: A B C or A1 B1 C1
Half Note: A2 'B2
Third Note: A3 B3 C3 ''C#3 ,,Db3
Quarter Note: A4 'D4 
Eighth Note: A8 A#8 Bb8
Any duration not filled in the measure will be a rest with a warning
Durations exceeding measure count will be cut short with a warning

Tied Notes: Previous note is held for additional duration
C ^C  A4 ^A8
| C | ^C | 'C#4 ^'C#4 ,C2 | ^,C |
Tied note must start as matching note ends or tie will be ignored

Slurred notes: No beginning or end between notes.  
There will be differences in how instruments implement this behavior.
|(A4 B4 C4) D4|
Slur markings are not allowed to be nested

Dotted notes: Increases duration geometrically by the number of dots
Single dot: A4. <=> A4 ^A8
Double dot: A4.. <=> A4 ^A8 ^A16
 
Rests: Underscore followed by fractional duration
Whole rest: _ or _1
Half rest: _2
Quarter rest: _4
Dotted rest: _4.

Stacato: Decreases note duration exponentially by number of backticks and inserts rest
A`  <=> A2 _2
A`` <=> A4 _2.
Bb8` <=> Bb16 _16
Bb8`` <=> Bb32 _16.

Chords: Notes played at the same time.
A-B-C A#-Bb-Db ''A-'A-A-,A-,,A
Chords can be tied
|A4-B4-C4 ^A4-C4-D4 B4-^C4-D2| 

Volume marks: Set the volume for notes following
0% 33% 80% 100% 

Dynamic volume: Changes the volume over the duration of notes inside X%<<Y% or X%>>Y%
0% < notes < 50%  
50% > A2 B4 > 25%  
80% | C | B2 B4 25% < D4 | A4 A4 Bb4 < 80% > C4 | D4 E4 > 25% C2 |
Dynamic markings are not allowed to be nested
