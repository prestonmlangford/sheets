Macros can be used for text substitution
define macro M with $M followed by white space and then the remaining text on that line
$my_macro abcd
multline macros can be defined with \ 
%other_macro wxyz \ 
             qrst

Signature markings can be placed anywhere in the file
They change the signature until another marking overides it
4/4 time -> 4/4
treble clef -> treble
50% volume -> 50%
120 beats per minute -> 120BPM

Measure bar: | tokens |

All tokens within measure are seperated by white space
| X Y |W Z|

Repeated measure bars are treated as one measure bar 
|tokens||tokens|

All whitespace is treated the same
|tokens   | tokens |
| tokens | 
<=>
| tokens | tokens | tokens | 

Repeat: Repeat sequence from start to end of repeat section natural number of times
| tokens   | plays the sequence 1 time
|: measures  :| repeats the sequence 1 time
|: measures ::| repeats the sequence 2 times
|: measures :N| repeats the sequence N times
|: measures :1| repeats the sequence 1 time
|: measures :5| repeats the sequence 5 times

|: A B C D | E F G2 :| => | A B C D | E F G2 | A B C D | E F G2 |

":" or ":N" repeat symbols must come at the start or end of the measure

Pitch / Note: A A#/Bb B C C#/Db D D#/Eb E F F#/Gb G G#/Ab

Pitch octave can be written in the scientific notation.
A4: 440 Hz
A3: 220 Hz
C4: 261.63 Hz

Octaves can also be denoted using something similar to helmholtz notation.
A base octave is defined in the musical signature of the sheet and upper and lower 
markings denote an octave higher or lower from the base octave.

Octave Higher / 2X frequency: A#' C' Bb'
2 Octaves Higher / 4X frequency: C#'' F''

Octave Lower / 1/2 frequency: A#, C, Bb,
2 Octaves Lower / 1/4 frequency: C#,, F,,

In general, the upper/lower marks can be applied to any note or chord which will shift the octave.

Midi notes can be written starting with the small letter m followed by the note number
A4 <=> m69

Duration: A natural number preceding the pitch representing the fraction of a whole note.
It means one whole note duration divided by N.  N for a quarter note (or 1/4) would be 4.  
Whole Note: A B C or 1A 1B 1C 1m54
Half Note: 2A 2B' 2m69
Third Note: 3A 3B 3C 3C#'' 3Db,, 3m90
Quarter Note: 4A 4D' 4m13
Eighth Note: 8A 8A# 8Bb 8m72

Small letters can be used for the more common note durations
w h q e  s  t
1 2 4 8 16 32

Tied Notes: Previous note is held for additional duration
Spacing around tie symbol is not necessary
C - C  4A-8A
| C | - C | 4C#' - 4C#' 2C, |-C, |

Slurred notes are held until the beginning of the next note.
Notes are played sequentially in legato fashion.  
Same notation as tied notes, but the pitch changes
|4A - 4B - 4C 4D|

Dotted notes: Increases duration geometrically by the number of dots
Single dot: .4A <=> 4A - 8A
Single dot: .qA <=> qA - eA
Double dot: ..4A <=> A4 - 8A - 16A

Rests: Underscore followed by fractional duration
Whole rest: _ or 1_
Half rest: 2_ h_
Quarter rest: 4_ q_
Dotted rest: .4_ .q_

Stacato: Decreases note duration exponentially by number of backticks and inserts rest
`A  <=> 2A 2_
``A <=> 4A .2_
`8Bb <=> 16Bb 16_
``8Bb <=> 32Bb .16_

Notes can be played at the same time using parallel measures.
The backslash mark means both measures are played at the same time.
| 2B 2C / A | A held 4 beats / while C held 2 beats then B held 2 beats.

You can add as many parallel measures as you want. 
3/4 | .2C / 4_ 2B / 2_ 4A |

Ties or slurs across parallel measures are applied in the same order
A held 4 beats, B held 4 beats, C held 8 beats
4/4 |A / B / C| _ / _ / - C | <=> |A / C / B| _ / - C | <=> |C / B / A| - C |

Notes can also be played simultaneously using chords
All pitches seperated by whitespace inside the parenthesis will be played simultaneously
(A B C) (A# Bb Db) (''A 'A A ,A ,,A)
4/4 |(A B C)| <=> | A / B / C |

All pitch and duration modifiers are applied to each note in the chord
4/4 .4(A B C)' the A B C chord is shifted up one octave end held for 1 1/2 beats
4/4 `4('A ,B C), the 'A ,B C chord is shifted down one octave end held for 1/2 of a beat
3/4 |4(A B C) 4(B C D) 4(C D E) | <=> | 4A 4B 4C / 4B 4C 4D / 4C 4D 4E |
3/4 |4(A B C)' 4(A B C) 4(A B C), | <=> | 4A' 4B 4C' / 4A' 4B 4C, / 4A' 4B 4C, |

Chords can be tied
|4A 4B 4C 4(A B C)| - 4(A B C) 4A 4B 4C| <=> 
|4A 4B 4C 4A / .2_ 4B / .2_ 4C | - 4A 4A 4B 4C / - 4B .2_ / - 4C .2_ |

Or slurred
|2(A C E) - 2(B D G)|

If the same notes are in the slurred chord, those pitches will be tied.
|2(A B C) - 2(B C D)| <=> |2A - 2D / (B C)| 

Ties have priority over slurs.
In the below example, C is held for 3 beats, B for 2, and A for 1.
3/4 |4C - 4(B C) - 4(A B C)| <=> | .2C / 4_ 2B / 2_ 4A |

The easiest way to play notes at the same time is to add another instrument track!

Volume marks: Set the volume for notes following
0% 33% 80% 100% 

Dynamic volume: Changes the volume over the duration of notes inside X%<<Y% or X%>>Y%
0% < notes < 50%  
50% > A2 B4 > 25%  
80% | C | B2 B4 25% < D4 | A4 A4 Bb4 < 80% > C4 | D4 E4 > 25% C2 |
Dynamic markings are not allowed to be nested
